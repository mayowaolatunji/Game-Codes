# Blok FlipGame

The Blockink.io first product_under development.

This is a Quest-as-service game deployment that intersects between the web2 gaming experience and web3 marketing.
The first gameplay to be launched is the flipCard game tangled with token mint and web3 marketing quests.

Each winners are rewarded with convertable points that are minted into exchangeable cryptocurrencies. This is preceeded by web3 culture marketing practices.

## Game Design & architecture.

### -Game Layout

The first release of the game is a 12 card game with 3*4 layout.
Each card with a front-face and back-face; the front face is hidden behind the backface.

#### Card Structure

There are 6 M-image card, duplicated to make up for another match in the game. 


### -Gameplay
A click on the first card reveales the front face carring a duplicated M-image. Upon the click on the second image, the front face is also revealed through a flop style.

If:

The first M-image === second M-image then the player scores a point.

Else: The first &  second M-image are flipped back to the front face.


### -The M-Image function.

The M in the M-image is defined as "Marketing." The term was derived as each image displayed per flip would be a marketing graphic stored for each section.

```
// Add the source code snippet for the M-image function here.
function mImageFunction() {
  // Your code here
}
```

This image could be a logo, colourful design or meme of or about a web3 brand or concept. The image or design would probabilistically serve as sharable content for each quest.
